# Disney sequel analysis

**The question:** Does Disney make more sequels now that it used to?

**The solution:** A short data analysis/article using R and ggplot2 visualizations (plus some finessing in Illustrator) to find an answer. The visualizations are loosely inspired by the Economist's 'graphic detail' series, prioritizing efficient data storytelling and succinct insights for a broad audience.


## Intro
These days, it can feel like every movie is a sequel or spin-off. 

But is that really the case? To find out, I had a look at the big cheese – or more accurately – the big mouse, by diving into Disney’s film catalogue.

Short answer: yes, there really are more follow up films than before.

Disney began releasing sequels in the 1960s, but their output kicked into a higher gear from the 90s onwards. And lately, remakes and spin-offs are trending the same way.

Prequels? Not so much. The last one, Oz the Great and Powerful (2013), didn’t exactly inspire a deluge of new films. Gee I wonder why!

I can hear you already  – But Disney makes all kinds of movies! Maybe they’re making more films in general, including originals!

And true! In the 1960s, Disney made 52 films. By the 2010s, that number had jumped to 129.

But here’s the thing: In the 1960s, only 6% of Disney’s films were sequels, prequels, remakes, or spin-offs. By 2010 that number had shot up to 44%

But some studios have more to answer for this slew of sequels than others. 

Curiously – Walt Disney Pictures, the company that started it all, releases the fewest non-original movies of the lot.

The real culprits? You guessed it – Marvel’s cinematic universe and Lucasfilm’s cinematic galaxy far, far away.

So job done right? Yes, today Disney is leaning more on its past work than it did in the past. In fact, since 2020 more than 1 in 3 Disney films were connected to a previous movie.

Does that mean that Disney has lost their spark? Are they less creative than they used to be? Not necessarily.

When Disney released their first film, Snow White and the Seven Dwarves, there weren’t exactly many movies to copy.

Did that mean they just churned out new idea after new ideal? Of course not! 

They borrowed from what was popular at the time – books, plays, nursery rhymes, fairy tales – let’s add them to our chart.

And when we do, we finally see a historic handover – a baton pass between zeitgeists. 

Because when they need inspiration for their movies, Disney has always looked to popular culture.

In the 1930s, that meant adapting popular books and plays. Today, it means adapting their own work.

In the middle, are the new ideas. Fresh, never before seen silver screen classics. And actually, they haven’t really changed much. Nearly half of all Disney movies are original stories, and that’s as true today as it was in the 1940s.

So are Disney really releasing more sequels? Yes. But for better or worse, they’re not being any less creative than they were 80 years ago.

But does it mean I’ll be rushing to the cinema for the seventh entry in the Freaky Friday franchise due later this year? I wouldn’t count on it.
